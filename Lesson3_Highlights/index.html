            <p class="lead">
                Version control is a system that records changes to one or more files over time so that the user can go back and retrieve them if necessary. Version control is very useful for graphic and web designers because you can keep every version of an image or layout. Version control is also very useful for teams who are working together on a project because version control can track multiple things and serve multiple purposes. It can be used to track who made a change and when, and can be used to compare different versions as well as backtrack to fix any issues that may arise.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
             Git is one of the most popular version control systems today. Many developers use Git for version control when it comes to projects or open source. Git also works well on a wide range of operating systems and integrated development environments which helps to explain its popularity. Git is classified as a distributed version control system which means that every developer’s copy of code is also a repository that can contain the full arsenal of information. In addition to the benefit of distribution, Git was also designed with a focus on performance, security, and flexibility. The most common criticism with Git is that it can be difficult to learn but with the amount of funtion that Git has, it is understandable.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
                When working with a repository it is important to note that each file in the working directory can be either “tracked” or “untracked”. Tracked files are files that Git already knows about. Untracked files are all of the other files that Git does not have in its snapshot. When you first clone a repository, all of your files will be tracked and unmodified since you have made no changes to those files. When you edit the files, Git will recognize them as modified since you made a change. As you are working, you are changing the modified files and committing all of those changes.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
                A few of the benefits of version control systems were stated earlier but there are plenty more. Version control allows teams to work more efficiently since everyone can work on a file at the same time. Even when working on your own, efficiency can be improved by what is called “branching” which is when you keep multiple branches of work separated but are able to bring them back to the main branch. Another major benefit of version control is maintenance. Being able to track down changes that were saved by version control is essential to fixing any issues with a file.

                <span class="text-muted">Version Control Types</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
                    There were 3 types of version control systems that were highlighted in this lesson. They were the local, centralized, and distributed. The majority of people who use version control methods fall under the “local” category because they just copy the files into another directory. While this is the simplest method, it can also lead to errors if the user isn’t careful enough. Centralized version control systems are focused more towards a team of developers. The way it works is there is a single server that stores all of the files. Distributed version control systems have the clients fully copy the repository and its history. This is a great safety net to prevent any loss if a server goes down.
